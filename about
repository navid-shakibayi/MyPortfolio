Cafe manager + codeaholic

By day, I sling lattes and froth dreams into reality at my cozy cafe. By night, I trade steaming mugs for glowing screens, weaving digital magic as a web developer.

I'm a junior dev with a bottomless cup of ambition, fueled by JavaScript, Tailwind CSS, HTML, React, and a sprinkle of (don't worry, secret ingredient) "so much more." I'm constantly brewing up new skills, eager to learn and tackle your digital projects, be it a website that's smooth as cold brew or an app that's as addictive as tiramisu.

Why code and coffee? Both involve meticulous creation, precise measurements, and the satisfaction of watching something delicious (or functional) come to life. Plus, there's no better fuel for coding than a perfectly brewed espresso (unless it's double).

So, next time you need a website that's as fresh as a pastry and interactive as a game of foosball, let's chat. I'm here to pour my heart (and code) into your project, one bean (or line of code) at a time.

Coffee artist by day, code alchemist by night. I'm a hungry junior dev brewing up skills (think JavaScript, Tailwind, HTML, React, and a secret dash of "more"). Craving new projects? Let's whip up a website smooth as cold brew or an app as addictive as tiramisu. Why both? Both are crafted with care, fueled by passion, and yield something satisfying (functional or delicious). Plus, double espresso is the ultimate coding fuel. Need a fresh, interactive website? Let's chat! I'll pour my heart (and code) into it, one line at a time.
